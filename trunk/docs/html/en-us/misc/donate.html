  <p>Tweener is a free, open-source software.  As such, it doesn't require any purchase or licensing to be used on  commercial projects or otherwise. </p>
  <p>Most open source projects, however, do allow a channel for donation so people can contribute to a project and keep it alive. </p>
  <p>Alas,  Tweener is not one of such projects, as it doesn't currently allow  donations to be made in any shape or form (other than  personally-delivered alcoholic beverage). </p>
  <p>However, if you enjoy  this project and are really interest in helping it, there are a number  of other open-source projects that we would like you to consider  donating to. These are open-source projects that are used by the people  who build Tweener, so <strong>a contribution to any of these projects is just like a direct contribution to the Tweener project</strong>. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tweener uses <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/" rel="nofollow">Robert Penner's easing equations</a> for tweening (as does every other actionscript tweening class or  extension you can find). Robert Penner doesn't take donations, but you  can contribute to Robert Penner by <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/profmx/" rel="nofollow">purchasing his book</a>.  Don't be fooled by the title: even though it's directed at Flash MX,  the math concepts behind it still make it worth and it's mandatory for  people interested in math control in Flash. </li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/" rel="nofollow">Mozilla Foundation</a> makes wonderful tools for everyday use. Heck, I'm editing this on a  Mozilla browser, I download and upload files through a Mozilla FTP  client, and I read my emails on a Mozilla email client, I probably owe  them my life already. Donate to the project <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and save my soul. </li>
    <li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">Tortoise SVN</a> is the SVN client and server of choice for many Subversion users, including our team. You can donate to their project <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/donate.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenOffice</a> may not be directly related to Tweener, actionscript, or even coding  tools, but this suit contains invaluable tools that are used everyday  by some of our team. Tweener-wise, I use Calc to keep a spreadsheet  with benchmark results and graphics when optimizing Tweener code. I  also owe them my life, as I have been a heavy OpenOffice user for a few  years. Donate to them <a href="http://contributing.openoffice.org/donate.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/" rel="nofollow">FlashDevelop</a> is the AS2/AS3 editor of choice for many people coding actionscript on  a PC, including some of our team. You can donate to them <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?t=42" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">7-Zip</a> is the file archiver used when creating the .zip files that are  featured as downloads on Tweener's page. It's also a great file  archiver. Donate to the project <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/register.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>And thank you!</p>
