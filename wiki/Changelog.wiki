 * 1.25.51 - CHANGED: !SpecialPropertyModifier class is now properly called !SpecialProperty; new actual !SpecialPropertyModifier class created, allows for the modification of other tweening values (ZehF)

*22 apr 07*
 * 1.24.51 - (AS3) FIXED: resumeAllTweens(), pauseAllTweens() and removeAllTweens() no longer outputs error messages when no tweenings exist (ZehF)

*15 apr 07*
 * 1.24.50 - (AS3) CHANGED: init() is not needed anymore; can still be used, compatibility is not broken (issue #5, http://code.google.com/p/tweener/issues/detail?id=5) (ZehF)

*14 apr 07*
 * 1.24.49 - (AS3) FIXED: getTweenCount() and getTweens() now work again, were broken by previous version (ZehF)
 * 1.24.48 - CHANGED: changes to comments only, to conform to ASDoc standards (ZehF)

*06 apr 07*
 * 1.24.47 - FIXED: new tweenings added to a previous point in time don't overwrite non-overlapping future tweenings anymore (ZehF)
 * 1.24.46 - FIXED: concurrent tweenings with no property set (used to create delays or timed events) are properly added and executed without overwriting each other (ZehF)
 * 1.24.45 - FIXED: skipUpdates don't count several different properties from the same tweening as separate updates anymore, and works even without properties (ZehF)
 * 1.24.44 - CHANGED: no getter/setter used anymore on internal classes when not needed, improves speed (ZehF)
 * 1.24.43 - CHANGED: `_transitionList`, `_specialPropertyList` and `_specialPropertySplitterList` are now properly defined as Objects instead of Arrays (ZehF)

*30 mar 07*
 * 1.23.41 - ADDED: pauseAllTweens() and resumeAllTweens() to pause all tweenings/transitions on the engine (ZehF)

*25 mar 07*
 * 1.22.41 - ADDED: special property `_autoAlpha` (ZehF)

*16 mar 07*
 * 1.22.40 - FIXED: tweenings whose objects cease to exist are deleted so their events won't run anymore (issue #4, proposed by Arthur Debert) (ZehF)

*12 mar 07*
 * 1.22.39 - FIXED: !EaseOutIn equations now work again (ZehF)

*05 mar 07*
 * 1.22.38 - ADDED: special properties for filter tweening: uses the `_filter_property` syntax, as in `_blur_blurX`. Only `_blur_*` supported right now (ZehF)
 * 1.21.38 - CHANGED: all initial properties values are now read at once (instead of one property at a time when first updating) to properly allow filter tweening (ZehF)
 * 1.21.37 - CHANGED: special property functions can now receive an additional array of properties; changed registerSpecialProperty, the specialPropertyModifier class, and rewrote the default special properties to use the new syntax (uses fewer functions) (ZehF)

*03 mar 07*
 * 1.21.36 - FIXED: fixed a great number of non-fatal issues that produced errors when compiling under strict mode (as pointed on issue #2, by Arthur Debert) (ZehF)
 * 1.21.35 - CHANGED: onStart now runs before the initial property values are read, so it can be used for setting them (issue #3, proposed by gvanvreckem) (ZehF)

 * 1.21.34 - ADDED: registerSpecialPropertySplitter() for special properties 'splitter' functions; now special properties such as `_color` and `_colorTransform` don't need to be hardcoded anymore. New class SpecialPropertySplitter, and new class AuxFunctions to keep all auxiliary functions separated (ZehF)
 * 1.20.34 - CHANGED: several speed optimizations for faster Tween addition and execution, specially on the AS2 version (ZehF)

*27 feb 07*
 * 1.20.33 - (AS3) FIXED: the special tweenings for sound (`_sound_volume` and `_sound_pan`) now actually work. They're not related to a Sound instance, however, but to a !SoundChannel instance, since AS3 treats Sound in a very different way (ZehF)

*26 feb 07*
 * 1.20.32 - CHANGED: pauseTweens, resumeTweens and removeTweens now can work on specific properties only. They're now based on a big, generic function too (ZehF)
 * 1.19.32 - (AS3) FIXED: pauseTweens, resumeTweens and removeTweens issues with lost scopes, and removed a bunch of unnecessary warning messages (ZehF)

 * 1.18.28 - FIXED: multiple warning issue in AS3 introduced by the new removeTweenByIndex() behavior (ZehF)

*27 jan 07*
 * 1.18.27 - FIXED: calling code that executed removeTweens() on the onStart/onUpdate/onComplete events could screw the tweening list and potentially cause the loss of some tweenings; made "safe" removals instead, and focused all actual tweening list removals on updateTweens() (ZehF)

*03 jan 07*
 * 1.18.26 - (AS3) FIXED: special `_`color properties now work on the AS3 version as well (ZehF)
 * 1.18.25 - ADDED: function .getTweenCount(), to count the number of properties being tweened for an specific object (ZehF)
 * 1.17.25 - ADDED: function .getTweens(), to list the properties being tweened for an specific object (ZehF)
 * 1.16.25 - ADDED: function .isTweening(), to find whether or not an object is being tweened (by Arthur Debert) (ZehF)

*14 dec 06*

 * 1.15.20 - FIXED: addCaller() wouldn't work if it was the first tweening to be called (engine not inited), plus other small bugs like missing event Params (ZehF)
 * 1.15.19 - (AS2) FIXED: try..catch blocks, like the AS3 version  - AS2 and AS3 versions are unified again (ZehF)
 * 1.15.18 - (AS2) CHANGED: works with TweenListObj instances now, like the AS3 version (ZehF)

*26 aug 06*
 * 1.12.15 - CHANGED: small changes on the var scopes to avoid duplicate declarations to conform to AS3 practices (thanks to NateC) (ZehF)
