#summary List of whoever was unlucky enough to help the Tweener project

= Credits =

Tweener was built and is maintained by a core group, with the help of several different people. Here's a listing of them.

== Core team ==

 * *[http://labs.zeh.com.br Zeh Fernando]* created the original Tweener version and still maintains the core code tightly secured under his mattress.

 * *[http://natejc.com/blog/ Nate Chatellier]* ported the original AS2 code to AS3 beginning at version 1.14.17 or so. Versions today are updated in sync, and Nate contributes with bug reports, fixes, and suggestions.

 * *[http://www.stimuli.com.br/ Arthur Debert]* contributed with many ideas, bug reports and fixes, as well as AS3 guidance on porting issues.


== Indirect code contributors ==

Tweener uses parts of code written by other people (read more about it on the [http://code.google.com/p/tweener/wiki/License License page]).

 * *[http://www.robertpenner.com/ Robert Penner]* is the one who created the original easing equations. Without him Tweener probably wouldn't exist. He also created the optimized pointOnCurve algorithm used on the bezier point calculations.


== Suggestions and other thanks ==

These people do not necessarily endorse Tweener, but they have contributed to the project in one way or the other so here's some acknowledgment. Thanks!

 * *Paulo Afonso* suggested ideas that led to the creation of the [addCaller] method.
