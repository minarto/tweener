#summary List of whoever was unlucky enough to help the Tweener project

= Credits =

Tweener was built and is maintained by a core group, with the help of several different people. Here's a listing of them.

== Core team ==

 * *Zeh Fernando* created the original Tweener version and still maintains the core code tightly secured under his mattress.

 * *Nate Chatellier* ported the original AS2 code to AS3 beginning at version 1.14.17 or so. Versions today are updated in sync, and Nate contributes with bug reports, fixes, and suggestions.

 * *Arthur Debert* contributed with many ideas, bug reports and fixes, as well as AS3 guidance on porting issues.


== Indirect contributors ==

 * *Robert Penner* is the one who created the original easing equations. Without him Tweener probably wouldn't exist. He also created the optimized pointOnCurve algorithm used on the bezier point calculations.


== Suggestions and other thanks (thanks!) ==

 * *Paulo Afonso* suggested ideas that led to the creation of the [addCaller] method.
 * *Francis Turmel* provided some great suggestions and a lot of inspiration driven from during long emails discussions.
 * Also thanks on issue reporting/suggestions for *gvanvreckem*, *Mathew Ray* and *Stacey Mulcahy*.
 * Other thanks/props also go out to *Gabriel Laet*, *Raul Carrasco*, *Cezinha*, *Eugene Zatepyakin*, *Ricardo "Mr. Doob" Cabello*, *John \m/ Grden*, *Mike Chambers* and *John Dowdell*.
